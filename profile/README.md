The description of work (as submitted in the call for abstracts) is here cross-referenced with each analysis repository:

> WCVP will be used to give a globally comprehensive taxonomy with distribution. The link from a taxon concept in WCVP to the nomenclatural event in IPNI will be used to gather two classes of additional data recorded in IPNI: (1) type citation data (recorded since 1997) and (2) article digital object identifiers (DOIs), recorded since 2012. Type citation data will be used to assess the digital availability of type specimens, using GBIF as a datasource (*see [catalog-number-access](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/catalog-number-access)*). A more general assessment of the availability of specimens will be made using the WCVP taxonomy as a lookup to the GBIF occurrence data on preserved specimens (*see: [wcvp-gbif-processing](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/wcvp-gbif-processing)*). On a regional level (using distributions from WCVP), these will be compared to the total number of specimens available using numbers derived from metadata records in Index Herbariorum (*see [specimen-distribution](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/specimen-distribution)*). Bibliographic data (DOIs) will be used to flag if the first publication of each name is available open access by looking up the DOI in the Unpaywall dataset, and again WCVP will be used to assess if this varies regionally (*see [ipni-oa](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/ipni-oa) and two comparators: (i) OA takeup in [gbif-literature](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/gbif-literature) and (ii) OA takeup in in the high-volume journal [Phytotaxa](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/phytotaxa-oa)*). ~~Depending on the state of the WCVP bibliographic data (cited as a reference supporting taxonomic status, ie the assertion of acceptance or synonymisation), it may be possible to make an assessment of the presence of relevant literature in the Biodiversity Heritage Library, and again, to see how this varies regionally, using WCVP distributions.~~

The paper production is also automated and is available in the [paper](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/paper) repository, which also holds the [complete submission](https://github.com/OA-WCVP/paper/blob/main/abstract-submission-info.md) made in the call for abstracts (in January 2022).
